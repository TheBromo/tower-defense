## 🏰 🥷 🏰 Short Introduction to the Game Tower Defense
Tower Defense is a captivating game that challenges players to strategically place towers to defend their base from waves of relentless enemies. This game is still an MVP. However, with further development, and with a variety of towers, enemies, and maps, players will find themselves immersed in a world of strategic decision-making and excitement.

### 🏗 Architecture & MVC

#### MVC Game 

```
 UI Thread                                                       GameThread

                      Observes                          Updates
```
The MVC model communicates with the Observer Pattern. 

- Game State hold all the properties that are needed to display in the UI
- The Game class is the Game Thread it simulates the game rules and physics and updates the Gamestate accordingly
- GameViewController displays the given Information of the GameState accordingly.

> When Rendering on the canvas the UI Thread is awaited because otherwise to many requests would clog up the UI Thread with the `Platform.runLater(...)` function.

#### Game Thread

The Game Thread is structured like the following:

```java
double previous = getCurrentTime();
double lag = 0.0;
while (true)
{
  double current = getCurrentTime();
  double elapsed = current - previous;
  previous = current;
  lag += elapsed;

  processInput();

  while (lag >= MS_PER_UPDATE)
  {
    update();
    lag -= MS_PER_UPDATE;
  }

  render();
}

```

1. The `update()` method is only called  when the given Time per Update (100ms) is elapsed.
2. The `render()` method is always called and renders as many frames as possible

> In our case the `render()` method sets the GameState to trigger a render and awaits for the render to finish.

This was implemented in the following PR [#48](https://github.zhaw.ch/PM2-IT22tbWIN-scmy-bles-krea/Team05-java.lang.NullPointerException-projekt2-tower-defense/pull/48)

#### Sprite System

> **Sprite** means: In computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is part of a larger scene (e.g., a 2D video game). Sprites can be static images or 
> animated graphics. [source](https://www.educative.io/answers/definition-sprite) 

The Sprite System loads images of for the given `SpritePath` enum. Here the number of variant of the same image and amount of images (more than 2 is animated). 

It has its own timer which changes the current image to display in a given interval.

> Through this system animations are enabled

This is how the code works:
```java
public class Sprite {
    private List<Image> sprites;
    private int intervalMs = 300;
    private int index = 0;
    private long lastUpdate = 0;

    public Sprite(SpritePath sprite) {
    ...
    intervalMs = randomUtil.getRandomInRange(sprite.minAnimationTimer, sprite.maxAnimationTimer); // not all animations play at the same speed
    lastUpdate = randomUtil.getRandomInRange(sprite.minAnimationTimer, sprite.maxAnimationTimer); // they dont start synchronized
    ...
    }
    
    public Image getSprite() {
        if (System.currentTimeMillis() - lastUpdate >= intervalMs) {
            continueIndex();
            lastUpdate = System.currentTimeMillis();
        }
        return sprites.get(index);
    }
    ...
```

`getSprite()` returns the Image which should be displayed of the whole set an is incremented if the interval was passed.
